#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Spotify data to discover more about the danceability and popularity of the music. 

#1. Created Spotify Table  
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#2. Determine the top 10 artist on the table
Select artist_name, popularity 
from bit_db.Spotifydata 
Order by popularity 
desc LIMIT 10;

#3. What tracks have danceability of .7 or greater?
Select track_name, artist_name 
from bit_db.Spotifydata 
where danceability <= .7;

#4. What tracks have a danceability of more than .7 and more than .5 energy?
Select track_name, artist_name, popularity 
from bit_db.Spotifydata 
where danceability > .7 and energy > .5 
order by popularity desc;

#5. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
showed their name and average popularity, and labeled them a “Top Star”

with Top_Star AS (
select s.artist_name, 
AVG (s.popularity) as average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
Group by s.artist_name
)
Select artist_name, 
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' as tag 
From Top_Star
Where Average_popularity >=90;

#6. Calculate the average popularity and danceability for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average danceability of .4 or above, 
showed their name and average popularity, and labeled them a “Dance”

with artist_danceability_CTE AS (

Select s.artist_name, 
AVG (S. Popularity) as a_popularity,
AVG (S.danceability) as a_danceability
From SpotifyData s 
Group by s.artist_name
)

Select artist_name, 
        a_popularity,
        a_danceability,
        'Dance' as tag
from artist_danceability_CTE
Where a_danceability >=.4 
Order by a_popularity desc;
